# WordInvaders
APCSA Final Project

Our program is a typing game where the userâ€™s goal is to survive waves of enemies. 
They would do this by typing the corresponding words attached to the enemies shooting their cannon eliminating the enemy if they type it in correctly. 
Our game will have multiple levels to it with one of our group members having designed an individual level with our own special features added on. 
These special features may include power-ups based on length of words entered, special enemies, changes in difficulty mid level and more.
